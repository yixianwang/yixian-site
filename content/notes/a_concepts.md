## Java is passed by Value or Reference?
- In Java, there are two kinds of data type, **Primitive** data types and **Non-primitive** data types.
- For primitive types, they are built-in data types in Java including int/short/long/float/double/char/byte/boolean. They are all passed by value.
- For non-primitive types, they are also passed by value, the value here is actually the memory address of the object. e.g. annotation, class, interface, enum, array.
- In conclusion all data types in Java are passed by value.

## static keyword

## Hashmap workflow
- Internally, Hashmap is an array of linkedList. 

## How many access modifiers?
- public: visible in all classes in all packages 
- protected: visible to all classes in the same package or classes in other packages that are a subclass 
- default: visible to all classes in the same package 
- private: visible only in the same class

## Pros and Cons of static

## Diff map and set. Can we have duplicate keys in map

## Given a series data, how to detect duplicate data and skip it?

## Comparable vs Comparator
- First, they are both functional interface, annotated with `@FunctionalInterface`
  - Comparable has one method `compareTo`
  - Comparator has one method `compare`
- Comparable is used to define the natural ordering of objects within the class itself.
- Comparator is used for external comparison logic.

## How GC works / GC generation
- When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap, which is a portion of memory dedicated to the program. Eventually, some objects will no longer be needed. The garbage collector finds these unused objects and deletes them to free up memory.

- A generational garbage collector collects the short-lived objects more frequently than the longer lived ones. Short-lived objects are stored in the first generation, generation 0. The longer-lived objects are pushed into the higher generations, 1 or 2. The garbage collector works more frequently in the lower generations than in the higher ones.

- When an object is first created, it is put into generation 0. When the generation 0 is filled up, the garbage collector is invoked. The objects that survive the garbage collection in the first generation are promoted onto the next higher generation, generation 1. The objects that survive garbage collection in generation 1 are promoted onto the next and the highest generation, generation 2. This algorithm works efficiently for garbage collection of objects, as it is fast.

### singleton vs immutable class



## JVM
- method area(after java 8, meta space): static, class template
- heap: objects
- vm stack: references and method
- native(c/c++) method stack: old api within jam

## ClassLoader
- Three types of classLoader
  - Bootstrap ClassLoader: to load the first pure java ClassLoader
  - Extension ClassLoader: to load extensions of core java from jdk extension library
  - System/Application ClassLoader: to load application type classes

## Class class
- It is used to describe the meta info inside a class.
- When a class is loaded from ClassLoader, one object of Class class will be created.
- With that object, we can call `getClass()` method or `.class` field to get the instance of the Class class.

## Reflection API
- Give us the ability that during the runtime, we can inspect and modify classes, methods, and fields dynamically. 
- It's not necessary to know everything about an object or class at compile time, instead we can discover them during the runtime.
- Reflection API is powerful, but there are some performance considerations. Generally speaking, it's slower than direct method calls, because it has overhead involves runtime type checking and method invocations. So in some performance-critical scenarios, we should not use Reflection API.

## Data Structures
- **Map** is not in **Collection** framework. That's why we cannot directly iterate key-value pairs within any Map implementation.

### Collection vs Collections
- **Collection** framework is for data structures.
- **Collections** is a class. That class contains lots of static methods including reverse/sort. That can help us manipulate our data structures including arrays.

### Comparison between any pair of data structures

## Java Flight Recorder
- It's a place that we can monitor our Java application. To check if there is any bottleneck for our web application regarding to the hardware and resources.

- Java Flight Recorder(since java 11 is free)
- jconsole
- IntelliJ profiler
- Spring Actuator

## Generic Data type
- Why: it gives us the ability that to make classes and methods more flexible and reusable by allowing them to operate on various types. It also provides compile-time type safety.
- How: 
  - type bounds: there are two types of bounds: upper bound(`extends`, <), lower bound(`super`, >=)
  - wildcard generics: it has greater flexibility, and it can also be bounded with those extends and super keyword.

## Design Patterns
### Singleton
- [reference](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)
- there is only one object we can create from the class.
- pros: 
  - singleton can work like a global variable
- cons: 
  - it's hard to do a unit test.
  - it needs special treatment in multi-threading programming 

### Simple Factory
- [reference](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-comparison)
- there is a creation method with some parameters. with those parameters we can choose which class to use for instantiating the object.
- pros: 
  - it makes the code loosely coupled.
- cons: 
  - over time, the methods might become too big. in this case, we need to convert the simple factory design pattern into **Factory Method**, to introduce some subclasses to handle this situation.

### Builder
- is used to simplify the process of building a complex object.
- pros:
  - we can construct object step by step, and reuse the construction codes.
- cons:
  - it would have many extra codes like having many extra classes and methods

#### Builder vs Factory
- Factory design pattern hides the process of object creation. Users just ask for what they need.
- Builder design pattern allow users to know what is set for the object.

### Proxy
- In practice, the proxy has the same interface as a service, which makes it interchangeable with a real object when passed to a client.
- There are two types of proxy: the static proxy and the dynamic proxy.
- The static proxy requires developer to know the target class in advance, whereas the dynamic proxy doesn't, because the proxy class can be dynamically created by JVM during the runtime.

## Java8 new features
### Functional interface
- it's a kind of interface that has only 1 abstract method.
- it can have multiple default methods and static methods.
- i.e. Runnable, Callable, Comparator, etc.

### Lambda


## HTTP status codes
```
200 OK -- the request succeeded.
201 Created -- the request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result.
202 Accepted -- the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
204 No Content -- the request succeeded, but that the client doesn't need to navigate away from its current page.

307 Temporary Redirect -- the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the Location headers.
308 Permanent Redirect -- the resource requested has been definitively moved to the URL given by the Location headers.

400 Bad Request -- the server cannot or will not process the request due to client error.
401 Unauthorized -- the request has not been completed because it lacks valid authentication credentials.
403 Forbidden -- the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.
404 Not Found -- the server cannot find the requested resource.

500 Internal Server Error -- the server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.
```

## Bean Scope
1. Singleton(default). The IoC container creates only one instance of the bean, and reuses it whenever that bean is requested. This is the default cope in Spring.
2. Prototype. The Ioc container creates a new instance of the bean every time it is requested. 
> Only valid in the context of a Spring Web ApplicationContext.
3. Request. A new instance of the bean is created for **each HTTP request**.
4. Session. A new instance of the bean is created for **each HTTP session**.
5. Application. A single instance of the bean is created for the entire web application context. This means all requests and sessions share the same instance of the bean.
6. WebSocket. Similar to session scope, but designed for WebSocket-based interactions.

### Choose Appropriate Scope
- Singleton is suitable for stateless beans or beans that are expensive to create.
- Prototype is useful for stateful beans or beans that need to maintain their state separately.
- Request, Session, and Application scopes are suitable for beans that hold web-related state information and need to be scoped accordingly.

## Inversion of Control
- It is a principle which **transfer the control of the objects** to a container or framework.

## Dependency Injections
1. Constructor Injection: for **mandatory dependencies** so that our bean is ready to use when it is first time called.
  - pros:
    - All required dependencies are available at initialization time.
    - it's the only way for us to create immutable dependencies. It can avoid NullPointerException.
    - it also simplifies unit test.
    - Preventing errors in Tests
  - cons:
2. Setter Injection: only for **optional dependencies** to avoid **circular dependencies**.
  - pros:
  - cons:
3. Filed Injection: 
  - pros:
  - cons: it makes headache to test, so how do you test that without bring up spring context or using some type of reflection utilities to inject that. It can be done but it gives us a big headache when we do a private field in Autowired

## 3 Layers: Controller, Service, Dao

## Mock
### The difference between HashMap and HashTable
- Regarding to Thread Safety
  - HashTable is synchronized, so it's thread-safe.
  - HashMap is not synchronized by default, so it's not thread-safe. But we can use `synchronizedMap()` method to create a synchronized wrapper around it.
- Regarding to Performance
  - HashMap has better performance than HashTable, because HashTable is synchronized, it has some overhead.
- Regarding to Null keys and values:
  - HashTable doesn't support any null key or null value.
  - HashMap support both null key and null value. And the null key will put at index 0.
- Regarding to Iteration
  - We cannot iterate both of them during modification in another thread.
  - Even with HashTable is thread-safe, we cannot do that.
  - So we should find a way to make sure, during the iteration, there will not modification happen anywhere.

### Exceptions that we are familiar with
- Checked Exceptions: 
  - it means they will be checked at compile-time. 
  - we must handle it in our code. either with `try-catch` block or throw its responsibility to up the call stack some universe place.
  - i.e. IOException, SQLException, FileNotFoundException

- UnChecked Exceptions
  - it's runtime exception. The handling is optional, if we don't handle it, it will propagate up the call stack until get caught or causing the program terminate.
  - i.e. IndexOutOfBoundException, NullPointerException, ArithmeticException

### Java 8 new features
- Functional Interface
  - it's a kind of interface that has only 1 abstract method.
  - it can have multiple default methods and static methods.
  - i.e. Runnable, Callable, Comparator, Comparable, etc.

- Lambda expressions
  - it's just method without a name

- Method Reference
  - it's a way to let us create a reference to a method without invoking it.

- Stream API
  - It's let java can program in a way just like other functional programming language.

- Optional Class
  - it's just warp the original object, to handle the situation like null reference

- CompletableFuture

### In SpringBoot, the difference between Controller and RestController annotation

### Bean Scopes
1. Singleton(default). The IoC container creates only one instance of the bean, and reuses it whenever that bean is requested. This is the default cope in Spring.
2. Prototype. The Ioc container creates a new instance of the bean every time it is requested. 
> Only valid in the context of a Spring Web ApplicationContext.
3. Request. A new instance of the bean is created for **each HTTP request**.
4. Session. A new instance of the bean is created for **each HTTP session**.
5. Application. A single instance of the bean is created for the entire web application context. This means all requests and sessions share the same instance of the bean.
6. WebSocket. Similar to session scope, but designed for WebSocket-based interactions.

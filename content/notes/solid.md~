## S -  Single-responsibility Principle
- **DEFINE**: The interface responsibility should be single and not take on too many responsibilities.
- Applies to interfaces, classes, and methods.
- The focus of the single responsibility principle lies in the division of responsibilities, which is often not static and needs to be determined based on the actual situation.
- **PROS**: It can reduce class complexity, clarify responsibilities between classes, improve code readability, and make it easier to maintain.
- **CONS**: The knowledge and skills required of technicians are high, and sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between responsibilities.

## O - Open-closed Principle
- **DEFINE**: when someone else wants to modify the software function, he cannot modify our original code and can only add new code to achieve the purpose of modifying the software function.
- **EXAMPLE**: we should can only create a new class to implement interface.

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **DEFINE**: For users, where the parent class can be used, its subclasses can also be used, and the expected results are consistent.
- It not only refers to the syntax level consistency, but also includes the implementation consistency.

## I - Interface Segregation Principle
- **DEFINE**: Don't throw a large and comprehensive interface to users, but separate the interface that each user cares about.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle
- It is recommended that users rely on an abstract class or interface instead of relying on a implementation.

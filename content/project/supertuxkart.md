- Designed deep networks for a racing simulator, SuperTuxKart with Pytorch
- Trained linear model and multi-layer perceptron model to classify images from SuperTuxKart
- Trained a convolutional network to classify images from SuperTuxKart
- Built classification network fully convolutional and solved a semantic labeling task (labeling every pixel
in the image)
- Implemented an object detector
- Trained a CNN to do vision-based self-driving in SuperTuxKart
- Programmed a SuperTuxKart ice-hockey player (AI that plays ice-hockey)

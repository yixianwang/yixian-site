## Project 1: Online Learning Platform
- Description:

  - An Online Learning Platform where users can enroll in courses, access course materials, and track their progress. Instructors can create and manage courses, upload materials, and interact with students. The platform will include user authentication, a RESTful API, and a front-end interface.

### Features:
1. User Management:
    - User registration and authentication (students and instructors).
    - Profile management.
    - Role-based access control.
2. Course Management:
    - Instructors can create, update, and delete courses.
    - Upload course materials (videos, PDFs, etc.).
    - Course categorization and tagging.
3. Enrollment and Progress Tracking:
    - Students can enroll in courses.
    - Track progress through course completion.
    - Certificate generation upon course completion.
4. Interactive Components:
    - Discussion forums for each course.
    - Q&A section for student-instructor interaction.
5. Search and Filtering:
    - Search courses by keywords.
    - Filter courses by category, difficulty level, and popularity.
6. Admin Dashboard:
    - Overview of platform statistics (number of users, courses, enrollments).
    - Manage users and content.

### Technologies and Tools:
1. Backend:
    - Spring Boot: Core framework for building the application.
    - Spring Security: For authentication and authorization.
    - Spring Data JPA: For database interactions.
    - Hibernate: ORM framework.

    - Swagger/OpenAPI: For documenting the RESTful API.
4. Testing:
    - JUnit: Unit testing.
    - Mockito: For mocking dependencies.
    - Spring Boot Test: Integration testing.
5. DevOps:
    - Docker: Containerization of the application.
    - CI/CD: Integration with GitHub Actions or Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
    - Kubernetes: For orchestration (optional, for advanced deployment scenarios).
6. Other Tools:
    - Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code.
    - MapStruct: For object mapping.
    - Thymeleaf/Freemarker: (Optional) If you want to add server-side rendering capabilities.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Project Setup:
    - Initialize a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
    - Set up the project structure and dependencies.
2. User Management Module:
    - Implement user registration and login using Spring Security.
    - Set up role-based access control.
3. Course Management Module:
    - Create entities for Course, Material, Enrollment, etc.
    - Develop RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.
4. Frontend Development:
    - Set up a React project.
    - Create components for user authentication, course listings, and course details.
    - Implement state management using Redux.
5. Interactive Components:
    - Add features for discussion forums and Q&A sections.
    - Implement real-time updates using WebSockets (optional).
6. Admin Dashboard:
    - Develop an admin interface for managing the platform.
    - Display key metrics and provide management functionalities.
7. Testing:
    - Write unit and integration tests.
    - Ensure code coverage and reliability.
8. Documentation and Deployment:
    - Document the API using Swagger/OpenAPI.
    - Containerize the application using Docker.
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

### Final Steps:
- Code Quality: Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
- Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku).
- Showcase: Add the project to your GitHub or personal portfolio. Write a comprehensive README.md file explaining the project's features, setup instructions, and usage.

## Project 1 Plan: Online Learning Platform
### Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Configuration
1. Initialize Spring Boot Project:
    - Use Spring Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project.
    - Add dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, MySQL/PostgreSQL Driver, Lombok, and Thymeleaf (if using server-side rendering).
2. Set Up Database:
    - Configure database connection in application.properties or application.yml.
    - Create initial database schema using JPA entities.

### Phase 2: User Management
